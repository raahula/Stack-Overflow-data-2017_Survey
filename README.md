This project is based on Python 3.7.0 (default, Jun 28 2018, 08:04:48) running in an anaconda 5.3.0 distribution.

## Summary:
This project consists of a workbook in which I have done analysis on the Stackoverflow 2017 survey data, in order to glean information about how to succeed in the coding world. The main attributes that I am looking for are high salary and high job satisfaction.

## File descriptions:

The project consists of the following files.
- Analysis.ipynb                #Comprises of all the code used in the project
- README.md
- survey_results_public.csv     #Contains the survey results
- survey_results_schema.csv     #Contains the attribute descriptions for the survey data

## Results:
The results of the analysis have been published at this [link](https://medium.com/@raahula.dixit/job-satisfaction-and-success-in-the-how-how-to-succeed-in-the-coding-world-3a64d4a0e843)
